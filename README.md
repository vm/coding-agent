# Nila Code

A powerful CLI-based coding assistant powered by Claude (Anthropic) that can read, edit, and create files, list directories, and run shell commands. Built with TypeScript, React (Ink), and Bun for a blazingly fast development experience.

## Features

- **File Operations** - Read, edit, create, and manage files with natural language
- **Directory Navigation** - List and browse directory contents
- **Command Execution** - Run shell commands and scripts
- **Conversational Interface** - Maintains context across multiple interactions
- **Tool Visibility** - Real-time feedback on executed operations
- **Token Usage Tracking** - Monitor API usage with detailed statistics
- **Beautiful Terminal UI** - Clean, responsive interface built with React Ink
- **Test-Driven Development** - Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your system
- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone and install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nila-code
   bun install
   ```

2. **Set up your API key:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
   ```

3. **Start coding:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project
   cd /path/to/your/project
   
   # Start Nila Code
   bun start
   ```

## Usage Examples

### File Operations
```
"Create a React component called Button in src/components/"
"Read the tsconfig.json file and show me the compiler options"
"Update package.json to add lodash as a dependency"
"Delete all .log files in the current directory"
```

### Development Tasks
```
"Set up a new Express.js project with TypeScript"
"Run the tests and show me the results"
"Build the project and check for any errors"
"Create a Dockerfile for this Node.js app"
```

### System Operations
```
"Show me the git status and recent commits"
"Install dependencies and start the development server"
"Find all TODO comments in TypeScript files"
"Check the disk usage of this directory"
```

### Multi-step Workflows
```
"Create a new feature branch, add a login component, and run tests"
"Refactor the user service to use async/await, then update the tests"
"Generate API documentation and deploy to GitHub Pages"
```
