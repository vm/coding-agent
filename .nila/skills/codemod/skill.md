# Code Modifier

Perform automated code transformations and migrations. Use the `migrate.ts` script to apply codemods across files.

The script can:
- Find and replace patterns in code
- Transform AST nodes
- Apply migrations across multiple files
- Generate migration reports

Example usage: Migrate all instances of `oldFunction` to `newFunction` in TypeScript files.
